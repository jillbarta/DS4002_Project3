## Data

|Variable   |Description                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
|Year       |November of each year                               |
|Anomaly    |The departure from the long-term average temperature|

This data is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and uses a reference value equivalent to the long-term average temperature of 1901 through 2000 to determine the observed temperature anomalies.
